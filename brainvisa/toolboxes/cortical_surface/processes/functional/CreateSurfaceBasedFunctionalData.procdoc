    <xhtml name="long"><h4>Projection of fMRI data onto cortical surfaces using convolution kernels</h4>
This process aims at creating surface-based maps out of volume-based fMRI data. It takes as input a 4D volume, containing an fMRI (BOLD) timeserie (<i>fmri_data</i> parameter), and a mesh of the grey / white matter interface (<i>white_mesh</i> parameter), like the one produced by Morphologist pipeline. It generates a map (also referred as texture, <i>timeserie_texture</i> parameter) assigning each node of the mesh with a functional timecourse. This map can then be taken as an input of the Surface-based Structural Group Analysis pipeline.<br/>
<br/>
This pipeline consists as follows :<br/>
- first it computes an average 3D volume from the functional 4D volume (step 1)<br/>
- this average volume is used as a reference template to register the white_mesh surface with (step 2 - 3).<br/>
- from the white_mesh surface, a set of convolution kernels is computed (step 4). <b> Check that the kernels are produced at the same resolution as the input fMRI volumes !</b><br/>
- the final process takes the kernels, the fMRI 4D volume and the cortical mesh to produce a surface-based fMRI map<br/><br/>
