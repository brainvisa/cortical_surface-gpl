    <xhtml name="short">This process fits a General Linear Model on fMRI data which has previously been converted in a surface-based representation (see <b>Projection of fMRI data onto the cortical surface using convolution kernels</b>). It results in a surface-based SPMt map, according to a given set of regressors and contrast. The process can take deal with several subjects at the same time but <b>it does not compute a group map</b>, instead it computes one individual map per subject. </xhtml>
