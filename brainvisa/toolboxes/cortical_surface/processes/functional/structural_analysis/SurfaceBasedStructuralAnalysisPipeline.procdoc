    <xhtml name="long">This process allows to perform group analyses of fMRI data following the surface-based structural approach as described in Operto et al., 2012. It takes as inputs a set of cortical meshes, one per subject, a set of functional maps (e.g. fMRI volumes projected on these same meshes, using convolutions kernels, see <i>Projection of fMRI data onto cortical surfaces using convolution kernels</i>), a text file giving the sequence of timestamps associated to the fMRI data (e.g. the starting time of each scanned volume) and a vector defining a contrast. On the other side, it generates a set of individual statistical parametric maps (one per subject) and as many primal sketches graphs. These graphs represent group-level activations.<br/><br/>
